Apart from creating report pages, we can also add these pages to the Process Automation Manager 7 Business Central workbench navigation.

To do this:

1. Go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Pages* and click on the *Navigation* icon on the left-hand side of the screen.
2. Expand the *Workbench* entry. Note that the main menu items of Business Central are listed: Design, Deploy, Manage, Track
3. Add a new top-level menu called *Report* by clicking on the gear icon next to the *Workbench* entry and select *+ New Group*. Give the the group the name `Report`{{copy}}.
4. Save the changes by clicking the *Save* button.
5. Click on the gear icon next to the *Report* group and click on *+ New Page*. Select the *active-tasks-report* and save the changes.
6. Click again on the gear icon next to the *Report* group and click on *+ New Page*. Select the *customer-satisfaction-report* and save the changes.
6. Click on the *Menu* on the top bar of the workbench and note that a new *Report* group has been added to the menu which contains our 2 report pages. Click on one of them to open the given page.

The Business Central workbench contains a lot more options to create even more sophisticated pages and applications, including navigation elements like menu-bars and carousels. We leave it as exercise to the user to create these more advanced pages and applications with these page navigation components.
